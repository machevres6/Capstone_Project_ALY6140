# Capstone_Project_ALY6140
For my final project I decided to go with a topic that I am very passionate about. I am a Biomedical Engineer and physiological conditions were part of my studies.  I also have a personal attachement to this because I have lost members of my family to heart conditions.  I had seen a plethora of datasets before this one but none catched my eye.  

## The Data Set: 
This is a widely used dataset, mainly because the University of California Irvine's department of Machine Learning made it public in their data [repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease "Heart Disease Data Set") and since it has been used in many occasions. [downloaded from](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci "Kaggle Dataset")

The dataset has a total of 14 attributes that contribute to determining if the patient has or does not have a heart condition. 

Attributes: 

1. Age : Age of Patient in years. 
2. Sex 
    * Male = 1
    * Female = 0
3. CP : Chest Pain Type:
    * Typical Angina = 1
    * Atypical Angina = 2
    * Non-Anginal Pain = 3
    * Asymptomatic = 4
4. TRESTBPS : Resting Blood Pressure (in mmHg on admission to the hospital)
5. CHOL : Serum Cholestoral in mg/dl
6. FBS : Fasting Blood Sugar \> 120 mg/dl
    * True = 1
    * False = 0
7. RESTECG : Resting Electrocardiographic Results
    * Normal = 0
    * Having ST-T wave abnormality = 1
    * Showing Probable or definite LV Hypertrophy = 2
8. THALACH : Maximum Heart Rate achieved
9. EXANG : Exercise Induced Angina
    * Yes = 1
    * No = 0
10. OLDPEAK : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. SLOPE : The slope of the peak exercise ST segment: 
    * Upsloping = 1
    * Flat = 2
    * Downsloping = 3
12. CA : Number of Major Vessels colored by Flourosopy (range = 1-3)
13. THAL:
    * Normal = 3
    * Fixed Defect = 6
    * Reversable Defect = 7
14. HeartConditionPresent : Diagnosis of Heart Disease
    * Yes = 1
    * No = 0


With this information I would like to:  
1. See how the attributes correlate to wether or not there is a heart condition present. 
2. Predict if a heart condition is going to be present with the patients attributes described above.
